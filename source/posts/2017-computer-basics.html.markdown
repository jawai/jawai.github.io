This is for anyone who has trouble understanding the basic components of their computer.

Think of your computer as the kitchen in a restaurant.

The **Central Processing Unit** (CPU) is like the chef of the restaurant. The faster the chef prepares the food, the faster the food will be served.

The **Random Access Memory** (RAM) can be thought of as the stove-top and counter space where the chef prepares all of the food. The more stove-top and counter space available, the more dishes the chef can prepare at the same time. For example, a stock can be brewing while bread dough is resting, and the chef is preparing the fish all at the same time. If there isn’t enough space, then the chef is limited on how much he can work on. The more dishes or ingredients involved, the harder it is to fit everything on the stove-top and counter - this is what a program that uses a lot of RAM looks like.

The **Hard Drive** is similar to the storage in the kitchen such as the refrigerator. The refrigerator keeps all of the ingredients. Whenever one is needed, the chef can search the refrigerator for the ingredients and retrieve them. If there’s not enough space in the refrigerator, then the chef can decide to install another one or throw out some of the existing ingredients to make some more room.
