If you think of supermarket as a computer, then the Central Processing Unit (CPU) would be the cash register. The **clock speed** of the CPU can be thought of as the speed at which the cashier is putting the items through the cash register. The faster the person is at putting through all of the items in your basket, the faster you will be on your way - the faster the clock speed. In a way, you are just one of the ‘instructions’ the supermarket has to process in order to move on to the next instruction/person.

Now, picture yourself in a supermarket where there is only one cash register running. This would be similar to having a **single core** CPU. The queue has about 10 people ahead of you. As you can imagine, you want the cashier to be registering product as fast as possible so that you can be out sooner.

What would happen if a second register opened up? Suddenly you’ll have roughly half the people move over to that new line so that it’s about 50/50. That’s exactly what a **dual core** processor would look like. If your computer has two separate tasks to be completed at the same time, each core can handle the instructions to make everything more efficient. As you can imagine, if you open up two more cash registers, it’ll split to about 2-3 people for each line. This is what a **quad core** processor would look like.

If you had one cashier who was able to handle two queues at the same time, that would be known as **hyper-threading**. So what you have here is one core that seems like two and is doing two instructions all at the same cash register! As logic dictates and is the case with CPUs, one cash register per queue is definitely a better system.

If the person who is putting through your items, is also the person who is putting them all into bags, as you can imagine, there’s a bit of an efficiency issue here. That same person will type in your item then will have to turn and place that item in a bag. When a bag is full, they will have to move the bag and open up a second one. What if you had one employee running the cash register and a second employee placing all of the items into a bag? You’ll likely see a pretty big jump in efficiency. This is what **turbo boosting** is. It’s all about making your system more optimized.
