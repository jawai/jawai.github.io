The three main properties to a display are its **size**, **resolution**, and **pixel density**. These properties will generally dictate its cost and the sharpness of image you see on the display.

The display **size** is the length of its diagonal.

A **pixel** can be thought of as the atom of your display - the smallest element that can be displayed on your screen.

The **resolution** represents the number os pixels on your display but does not represent how sharp that image will be.

If you have a 14 inch display with a resolution of 640x480 then you have a display that has a diagonal length of 14inches, a _horizontal resolution_ of 640 pixels, and _vertical resolution_ of 480 pixels.

Today, the most common displays are 720p, 900p, and 1080p. The number represents the vertical resolution of the display, in other words, the number of rows of pixels. The _p_ stands for progressive scan – this is the way the image is displayed on the screen. For a progressive scan display at 60hz, the image on the screen is completely refreshed 60 times per second.

The alternative method of displaying an image is _i_ for interlaced scan which refreshes alternative rows of pixels – it takes two full cycles to refresh every pixel on your screen. Progressive scan is generally better and is the most common type found on laptops. The difference in size between resolutions at 720p, 920p, and 1080p can be seen below.

The **pixel density** represents how many pixels there are in 1 square inch of your display. The higher the pixel density, the sharper and clearer the image on your display. Pixel desntiy is based on the resolution and size of the display.

If we had two displays of the same size, then the image to the left represents a display with low PPI while the image to the left has high PPI.

Why does PPI matter? If you’re like most people, you spend a significant amount of time staring at a display – think about your phone, laptop, desktop, and TV.

Displays are made for the devices they are going to be on. For example, you use your TV differently from your laptop and phone. On average, people sit 7-8 feet away from their tvs compared to 2-4 feet from their laptops, and 1-2 feet from their phones. If you’re ever in an electronics store and move close up to most TVs, you will notice that the image produced from that distance is really pixelated. Just remember that you won’t be watching your TV from that close up. TV manufacturers know this and take that into account when creating your TV to reduce the cost of production. This is the same for your laptop or phone display. Since a display is created for a particular type of device, you should  remember to compare apples to apples, that is laptop displays to other laptop displays.
